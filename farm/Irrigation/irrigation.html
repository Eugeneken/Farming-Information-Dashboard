				<h1>Ways of Irrigation</h1>
				<p>
					Irrigation is the process of supplying water to crops, plants, and vegetation to help them grow.
					 It is an essential aspect of agriculture, and there are different ways to accomplish it. In this 
					 report, we will discuss the various methods of irrigation.
				</p>
				<h2>1. Surface Irrigation</h2>
				<p>
					Surface irrigation is the most common and oldest method of irrigation. It is also known as flood
					 irrigation. In this method, water is supplied to the crops through canals, ditches, or pipes. 
					 The water flows over the surface of the land and is absorbed by the soil. This method is suitable 
					 for crops that can withstand waterlogging.
				</p>
				<h2>2. Sprinkler Irrigation</h2>
				   <p>
					Sprinkler irrigation is a modern method of irrigation that uses a network of pipes and sprinklers to 
					distribute water to the crops. The sprinklers are placed on the ground or mounted on poles, and they 
					spray water over the crops. This method is suitable for crops that require regular watering, such as 
					vegetables and fruits.
					</p>
					<h2>3. Drip Irrigation</h2>
					
					<p>Drip irrigation is another modern method that supplies water directly to the roots of the crops. 
						Water is supplied through a network of pipes and drippers, which are placed near the plants.
						 This method is suitable for crops that require less water, such as grapes, cotton, and citrus 
						 fruits.
					</p>
					<h2>4. Subsurface Irrigation</h2>
					
					<p>Subsurface irrigation involves supplying water directly to the roots of the crops through buried pipes. The water is absorbed by the soil through capillary action. This method is suitable for crops that require a constant supply of water.
					</p>
					<h2>5. Center Pivot Irrigation</h2>
					
					<p>Center pivot irrigation is a method that uses a large sprinkler system mounted on a pivot. The sprinkler system rotates around a central point, providing water to the crops in a circular pattern. This method is suitable for large-scale farming and is commonly used in the United States.
					
					In conclusion, irrigation is an essential aspect of agriculture, and there are several ways to accomplish it. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and farmers should choose the best method based on their crop requirements, soil type, and climate.</p>
